A simple Chrome extension for viewing RSS feeds.

Please note that this is for fun. The goal of this project is personal education, not to make a product. I have intentionally gone down incorrect design paths to try to understand first hand what makes a design good, and what makes it bad, instead of just taking another programmer's word for it.

I routinely check in unstable code, but do aim to return to stability when I decide I have the time to sit down and figure out what went wrong.

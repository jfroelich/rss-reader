mark_entry_read todos
* the on-load checks of object validity are weird. Why not just use basic assert and treat as errors? I don't remember how the code got into this state. I am bit concerned if I change these back to throwing error instead of just logging error and exiting, it will break stuff.
* refactor as set-entry-read-state, accept a boolean state parameter, and handle both cases (where true and where false)? Alternatively, create db-write-entry-property, have this decorate that. Alternatively, have the caller just call db-write-entry-property directly.
* create a write-entry-property module, then use that instead of this. In the interim, can consider refactoring this to basically wrap a call to it, maybe even keep the channel message type the same. Then slowly migrate all callers to call write-entry-property directly. This will potentially reduce the number of operations related to entries, and is more forward thinking in case new operations are added later (e.g. star/unstar-entry).

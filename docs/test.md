// TODO: review all tests and ensure that tests follow pathological paths in
// addition to the normal path. for example see the following url:
// https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/03_lu_010-017_final.pdf
// TODO: think of a nice way to ensure that each test uses a unique database to
// avoid any surprises when running tests concurrently. maybe use a prefix
// string parameter when calling each test function that is unique to that test
// function call
// TODO: consider enabling tests to somehow declare their own timeout instead of
// using the same timeout for all tests. actually, each test function should use
// a db named after the test itself. we know all test functions are unique?

## TODO
* if utils.js is just one function, name file after the one function, or something that is more specific to it. it is a code smell in the first place, but i am currently of the opinion that using a module-local utils file is fine here.
* if get_text_length is not a simple property accessor style of function, then the get qualifier in the name is misleading, because get denotes simple property access, not some kind of arcane calculation. therefore, this function should be renamed so that it better communicates that an approximation of the length is returned instead of the actual length, and that some unusual processing work is done that is more expensive than a simple property access call. the goal should be to minimize the surprise in the API surface. abstracting away this stuff is misrepresentation and careless. it would be different if the norm, the expected behavior, was that any get invocation could involve calculation, but i do not think that is the norm for this project

Returns a new string where the publisher information has been stripped, such as the string "Your Florida news" in the string "Florida man shoots self - Your Florida News". The algorithm identifies the publisher by looking for a delimiter and comparing the word count before and after it. If there is any problem, then the original title is returned.
